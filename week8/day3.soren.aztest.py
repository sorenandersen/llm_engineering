Most important is that you respond with the 5 deals that have the most detailed product description with price. It's not important to mention the terms of the deal; most important is a thorough description of the product.
Be careful with products that are described as "$XXX off" or "reduced by $XXX" - this isn't the actual price of the product. Only respond with products when you are highly confident about the price.
